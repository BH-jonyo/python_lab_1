# python_lab_1
The first python project I worked on for my course. 

This project is dubbed the Password generator. It is an introductory project into python programming and provides useful tips to master and practice different python codes for beginners. The main task is to create a program that generates passwords depending on different requirements of the users. The password list will contain, numbers, symbols, and digits. These are then shuffled to give a strong password.

Enjoy!
